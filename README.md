# Reinforcement Learning Projects

This repository is a collection of reinforcement learning (RL) projects implemented in Python and Jupyter Notebooks. It explores foundational RL concepts through hands-on examples and simulations.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **gridworld-mdp/**: A GridWorld environment modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), demonstrating algorithms like Value Iteration and Policy Iteration.
- **gridworld-dp/**: Explores Dynamic Programming in GridWorld, focusing on policy evaluation and improvement.
- **gambler-problem/**: The classic Gambler‚Äôs Problem, illustrating value function updates and optimal strategies.
- **ten-armed-testbed/**: Simulates the 10-armed bandit testbed for studying exploration vs. exploitation.
- **tic-tac-toe/**: A simple RL agent that learns to play Tic-Tac-Toe.

## üß† Features

- Implementations of core RL algorithms (e.g., policy/value iteration, dynamic programming).
- Clear, educational Jupyter notebooks for learning and experimentation.
- Modular code for easy navigation and extension.

## üß™ How to Use

Open any project directory and launch the corresponding Jupyter notebooks to explore the concepts and experiment with the code.
