🃏 Blackjack – Reinforcement Learning Agent 🎲

This project implements a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to play the classic card game Blackjack. By employing algorithms like Monte Carlo methods, the agent learns optimal strategies to maximize its winning probability against a dealer. ￼

✨ Features
