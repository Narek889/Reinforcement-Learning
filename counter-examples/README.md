# Counter-Examples

This folder contains counter-examples and supplementary materials for the Reinforcement Learning project.

## Directory Structure

### 📁 `/src`
Source code implementations for counter-examples and related algorithms.

### 📁 `/notebooks`
Jupyter notebooks demonstrating counter-examples, experiments, and analysis.

### 📁 `/book_images`
Reference images from textbooks and literature used in the project.

### 📁 `/generated_images`
Generated visualizations, plots, and images from experiments and analyses.

## Overview

Counter-examples are crucial for understanding edge cases and limitations in reinforcement learning algorithms. This collection provides:

- **Theoretical counter-examples** demonstrating algorithm limitations
- **Experimental code** to reproduce and verify counter-examples
- **Visual comparisons** between expected and actual behavior
- **Documentation** explaining the significance of each counter-example

## Getting Started

1. Review the notebooks in `/notebooks` for interactive demonstrations
2. Examine the source code in `/src` for implementation details
3. Compare generated results in `/generated_images` with reference materials in `/book_images`

## Contributing

When adding new counter-examples:
1. Document the theoretical basis
2. Provide reproducible code in `/src`
3. Create a notebook demonstrating the counter-example
4. Include visual comparisons and analysis
