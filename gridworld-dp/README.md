# ðŸ§­ GridWorld Dynamic Programming (DP)

This project focuses on solving the classical GridWorld problem using Dynamic Programming (DP) methods in Reinforcement Learning (RL). The primary techniques implemented are **Policy Iteration** and **Value Iteration**.

## ðŸ“– Overview

GridWorld is a standard environment in reinforcement learning literature, representing a grid-based world where an agent navigates to achieve certain goals. This project implements:

- **Policy Iteration**: Iteratively evaluates and improves a policy until it converges to the optimal policy.
- **Value Iteration**: Iteratively updates the value function until it converges, then derives the optimal policy.

These methods are grounded in the Bellman equations and assume a complete model of the environment's dynamics.
