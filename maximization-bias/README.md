# ðŸ§  Maximization Bias in Q-Learning

This project illustrates the concept of **maximization bias** in Q-learning and how **Double Q-learning** can mitigate it. It's part of a broader repository on reinforcement learning methods.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

In standard Q-learning, the use of the same values for both **action selection** and **action evaluation** leads to an **overestimation bias**â€”known as *maximization bias*. This can result in poor policy performance.

**Double Q-learning** is an alternative method that addresses this issue by decoupling selection and evaluation, significantly reducing bias and improving learning stability.
