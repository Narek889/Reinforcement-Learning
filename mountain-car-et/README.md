# Mountain Car Environment with Eligibility Traces

## Project Overview
This project implements reinforcement learning algorithms in the Mountain Car environment, specifically focusing on eligibility traces.

The Mountain Car problem is a classic reinforcement learning challenge where a car is placed in a valley, and the objective is to drive it up a hill. This environment is designed to demonstrate the differences between various reinforcement learning algorithms, particularly regarding the handling of temporally-dense environments.

## Key Features
