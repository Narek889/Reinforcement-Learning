- `src/` - Source code for the Mountain Car implementation

## Overview

The Mountain Car problem is a classic reinforcement learning task where an agent (car) needs to drive up a steep hill. The car's engine is not powerful enough to drive up the hill directly from a standstill. Therefore, the agent must learn to gain momentum by swinging back and forth in the valley before making it to the top.

## Implementation

The implementation uses reinforcement learning techniques to train an agent to solve the Mountain Car problem. For detailed implementation and results, please check the notebooks directory and source code.
