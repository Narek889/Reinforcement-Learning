Ten-Armed Testbed

Overview
The Ten-Armed Testbed is a reinforcement learning project designed to explore and demonstrate the fundamentals of reinforcement learning algorithms. This project focuses on the multi-armed bandit problem, a classic example in reinforcement learning where an agent must decide between multiple actions to maximize reward.

Features
- Implementation of various reinforcement learning algorithms.
- Simulation of the multi-armed bandit problem.
- Visualization of results and performance metrics.


Usage
To run the simulation, use the following command:
```bash
python src_all/main.py
```

Project Structure
- `src_all/`: Contains the source code for the project.
- `generated_images/`: Stores generated images from the simulations.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
