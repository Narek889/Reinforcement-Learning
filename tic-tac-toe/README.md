❌⭕️ Tic-Tac-Toe with Reinforcement Learning 🧠🎮

This project implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game using reinforcement learning (RL) techniques. Players can engage in matches between two RL agents or between a human and an RL agent. The RL agents are trained to play optimally, ensuring at least a tie when playing against each other or a human player.

✨ Features
	•	🤖 Play between two RL agents or a human and an RL agent.
	•	🧠 RL agents trained to play optimally.
	•	🧩 Modular code structure for easy understanding and extension.

🛠️ Requirements
	•	🐍 Python 3.x
	•	📁 Required Python files:
	•	state.py: Manages game states.
	•	player.py: Defines RL and human players.
	•	judge.py: Organizes and judges the game.
