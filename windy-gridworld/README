🌬️ Windy Gridworld – Reinforcement Learning Exploration

This project delves into the classic Windy Gridworld problem from Sutton & Barto’s Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction,
 implementing and comparing various reinforcement learning algorithms to navigate an agent through a grid affected by wind.

⸻

🌐 Overview

The Windy Gridworld environment is a grid-based world where certain columns have a “wind” that pushes the agent upward, 
adding complexity to the navigation task. The agent starts at a designated start state and aims to reach the goal state in as few steps as possible, 
contending with the wind’s effects.

🧠 Implemented Algorithms
	•	SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action): An on-policy temporal difference learning method that updates the action-value 
function based on the action actually taken.

📊 Results

The experiments demonstrate how each algorithm enables the agent to learn optimal paths in the Windy Gridworld environment. Key observations include: ￼
	•	SARSA: Learns a policy that considers the actual actions taken, leading to stable learning in stochastic environments.
